    headline: "15 tips for an effective social media marketing strategy",
    body: "1. Define your audience :-Social media allows you to both broaden your audience and narrow it at the same time: while you can make your public, organic content available to anyone and everyone on social apps, you can also target your content toward relevant segments of the millions of people who use social platforms every day.,Knowing detailed information about the kind of customer you’re trying to attract via social media will help determine what, where, and when you post content. So before you do anything else, you need to identify the target audience for your brand or product. ,Who is the intended user of your product? What are the characteristics and behaviors of your existing customers? What are their favorite social platforms? Once you’ve pinned down these details, you can take steps to ensure your social media content is reaching the right eyes. 2. Don’t use every existing platform :-Using more platforms is not necessarily better; spreading your efforts over too many channels can end up being a waste of time. While research shows similar rates of overall social media use in the U.S. across gender, income, and education levels, there’s a ton of variation in terms of which age groups use which platforms. For example, if your target audience is primarily teens, setting up a perfectly-optimized LinkedIn profile for your brand shouldn’t be a priority — you should instead head to the platforms teens actually use, like TikTok. On the other hand, if you’re selling products targeted to parents, you should instead look to Facebook.Take a look at which platforms your target audience uses, and make two lists: one with the platforms they use most, and one with the platforms they don’t use as much. Focus on building your social media presence through the former. New social media platforms emerge all the time, but here are the most popular ones you should consider right now:, .Facebook .YouTube .instagram .tiktok .twitter .Pinterest .LinkedIn, I’ll also note here that Amazon has its own mini social media platform built into its marketplace: Amazon Posts. Sellers can post recycled Instagram content and earn “followers” who can receive updates from their brand on Amazon.The platforms you choose will also come down to the kind of content you want to create. If you produce a lot of videos, you’ll want to share them on YouTube, Instagram, and/or TikTok. Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok are great places to garner influencer- and user-generated content. If you want to build a community around your brand or niche, try Facebook and Pinterest, where you can easily post instructional content and lifestyle images to large groups of friends and followers. Finally, LinkedIn can benefit brands who want to target career professionals or other businesses. It can also help establish a credibility in your niche. ,3. Claim your handles and usernames before they’re gone :- Your brand name is unique, but its availability as a social media username — also known as a handle — isn’t guaranteed. By sheer coincidence or calculated strategy, the handle that most closely matches your brand name (like @nike, @starbucks, or @junglescout) could already be in use in any number of platforms. ,A good rule of thumb is to claim your usernames across multiple social media platforms as soon as possible, even if you’re not sure you’ll use them much. Until you decide to either devote more time to a particular platform or delete your account, just make sure you post something every so often, or your account could be disabled due to “username squatting.” ,Keep the handles as similar as possible — both to each other and your brand name — across different platforms, so customers can easily find your official accounts. If you can’t claim your exact brand name, try some of these relevant variations. ,Once you attract enough of a following on each platform, you can apply for verification badges on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Pinterest. The “blue check mark” instantly lends more legitimacy to your brand’s official profile.  ,4. Find your voice and set your tone :-On social media, you can let your brand personality shine. Photo captions, video scripts, live streams, and your bio content each represent great opportunities to make your mission resonate with existing and potential followers. Use voice and tone to create a specific mood for your brand. What kind of emotions do you want to elicit from your audience? If your brand was a person, what character traits would they possess? What adjectives do you want your audience to associate with your brand? Let your answers to these questions guide how your brand speaks on social platforms. If you’re not sure where to start, try using the “big five” brand personality traits as a jumping off point: Excitement . Sincerity . Ruggedness . Competence . Sophistication , You can mix and match your emphasis on each of these traits to form a unique identity for your brand. You may want to change your tone as you create content for different platforms, especially when switching from speaking to a more casual or playful audience (like Instagram or TikTok) to one that’s more intellectual or professional (like Twitter or LinkedIn). Customers hold high expectations in terms of how brands should conduct themselves on social media. Content trends and popularity can shift wildly in the blink of an eye, and it’s incredibly easy to alienate your audience by recycling overplayed lingo or memes. But get it right, and your brand could reach viral notoriety — and the boost in sales that comes with that. Study the vocabulary your audience uses — how do they talk about products like yours? Speak the language of your target consumer. , 5. Use software tools to keep a calendar and daily schedule :- It’s important to post consistently to keep your social media content discoverable — at least once a day to keep the content suggestion algorithms on most platforms happy. The specific time of day at which you post matters, too, and varies for each specific channel. Try posting during peak hours, adjusting your timing until you find the window that earns your content the most engagement. ,Manually publishing posts each day can get annoying. Thankfully, there are a ton of scheduling apps available to keep you on track. Tools like Creator Studio, Sprout Social, Later, and Planoly let you schedule social posts across different platforms, visually plan your feeds, and discover optimal times to post through engagement data analytics. ,You should also stay on top of trending news in your niche, so you can post timely updates or reactions to events and stories your audience is following. You can set Google alerts for keywords related to your brand or industry, follow relevant hashtags and accounts on Instagram and Twitter, and use “social listening” tools like Agorapulse. Over time, followers may start setting alerts for your account to catch your fresh takes. , Keeping a long-term calendar is also useful for staying on top of seasonal sales events. Use social media to notify your audience about special deals or promotions, and entice them to shop your brand during seasonal shopping dates like Prime Day, Labor Day, Cyber Monday, or Mother’s Day.6. Build your following :- If you’re brand new to social media, it can be difficult to build a following. But earning more followers helps spread your content to a wider audience, so you have to put work into building your count. You may have heard about buying followers as a quick, cheap way to boost your account’s popularity — for a few dollars, you can reel in thousands of new followers overnight. This strategy can backfire: more often than not, the accounts you’re paying for aren’t operated by real people — they’re bots whose very existence violates most apps’ terms of service. Platforms like Instagram actively seek out signs of mass bot followership and shut down offending accounts, sending you back to square one. Don’t fall for paid follower schemes. Earn real followers by using these techniques instead: Post high-quality content on a consistent basis .Run giveaway campaigns or contests, Generate engagement through polls and questions, Make your content discoverable by using strategic hashtags, geotags, and account tagging features, Interact with users through livestreams,Join groups to network with people and brands aligned with your target audienceCollaborate with influencers, followers, or other brands , 7. Post high-quality, varied content :- The name of the game for social media is engagement. Put simply, the more likes, saves, shares, and comments a given social media post receives, the more likely it is that a given app’s algorithm will suggest it to other users. And while individual posts can get engagement for all kinds of reasons, one of the biggest determinants is you content’s quality. , Users want to see attractive, well-lit images, read authentic and insightful or funny captions, and watch dynamic, exciting videos. They also want to be entertained with new ideas and stories., There’s nothing necessarily wrong with posting the same kind of content all the time — some of the most popular accounts on Instagram and Twitter prove that if the format is entertaining enough, it never gets old. , But that’s not always true for brands. While displaying your products in action is important, making your social media feed hyper-focused on your products can feel too promotional and turn people off — social media users want to see organic content, not 24/7 ads. To keep your followers engaged, try posting a variety of different content, including:  User-generated lifestyle images (more on this below)“Inspirational” or “aesthetic” images relevant to your brandScreenshots or quotes from exceptional customer reviewsNews about your brand or industryMemes and reaction gifs Infographics Information about sales and promotional eventsEngagement prompts and questions , Content pillars constitute an effective framework for generating social content ideas. These refer to the three to five main topics or themes that you’ll set as the foundation for all of your content. Pillars should be specific to both your audience and brand, but broad enough to help you create multiple types of content for each. As Jenna MacLellan, Jungle Scout’s Social Media Associate, explains, “when planning my content, I have a few pillars I know work (like engagement questions) that I make sure to sprinkle in throughout the week.”Content pillars can include concepts as well as actions. Here are some examples:Entrepreneurship: words of wisdom from founders or inventors Humor: memes and reaction gifs Educate: infographics, webinars, and blog posts Engage: polls and question prompts Jenna notes that it’s less important than it used to be to have a cohesive feed. At the end of the day, “you’re better off just posting things you know your audience will find value in or will provoke emotion (laughter, inspiration etc.).” But some visual flow helps with grid-view platforms like Instagram — you can easily achieve that with a recurring color scheme and consistent font choices.Here’s a look at some of Jenna’s recent posts for the Jungle Scout’s Instagram account. Over just a few days, she’s used a few different content pillars to create a thematically varied but visually cohesive content grid: there’s an announcement about an upcoming event, our weekly activity roundup, a tutorial video, an inspiring CEO quote, an engagement prompt (“caption this!”) and an infographic from one of our data reports., Jenna knows our audience enjoys engagement prompts, memes, and Amazon-related updates, so she makes those a focus area. Use plenty of video content Video content should be central to your social media strategy. Users across all platforms love watching and sharing product-related videos, which let you showcase your product and its functionality from multiple angles and settings. Another great thing about social media video content is that it doesn’t have to be as polished as a TV commercial. You can easily shoot videos on a smartphone and upload them to Instagram as Reels, IGTVs, or Stories, or post them to TikTok. You’ll want to put more editing effort into anything you publish on YouTube, where viewers expect higher-quality video content. But you can always repurpose snippets of your YouTube videos for other platforms. 8. Celebrate milestones and accomplishmentsCelebratory posts are a no-brainer for generating engagement. Your audience wants to see you win — granted that you communicate accomplishments with genuine appreciation for your followers. Here are some achievements and events you’ll want to celebrate with your followers:Audience growth milestones (i.e. reaching 10K Twitter followers, 1 million YouTube views, etc.)Your brand’s birthday or anniversary Staff birthdays Awards your brand has earned Goals or achievements your customers accomplished while using your product Here’s how to make those celebratory posts feel sincere, not braggy:Thank your followers when you reach engagement milestones Feature UGC in your celebratory post Run a promotion, giveaway campaign, or a contest Make a charitable donation to a worthy cause 9. Seek engagement and encourage UGC User-generated content, or UGC, is invaluable to brands. By inspiring your followers and customers to post their own organic content about your brand, you build social proof and reap the benefits of free advertising. Instagram is perhaps the best platform for soliciting UGC — its algorithm was essentially built for the stuff. Hashtags, reposts, and Reels Remixes make it simpler than ever for followers to amplify your account and connect you to a wider audience. TikTok is another great place for UGC, where customers’ video reviews can easily and quickly go viral. Take a look at the Instagram feed for popular Amazon-based sportswear brand Baleaf. It’s almost entirely made up of lifestyle-image UGC submitted by happy customers from around the world.  10. Collaborate with niche influencer All this is not to say you shouldn’t pay people to promote your brand on social media. Influencers and affiliates can be invaluable assets, as their massive followings and knack for creating share-worthy sponsored content, or “sponcon,” can boost your reach beyond what you could accomplish alone. Gymshark, for example, has a robust Instagram influencer program. Content created by Gymshark’s roster of influencer-athletes has helped the brand earn 5.3 million followers and a $1.3 billion valuation in 2020.  As Jungle Scout’s resident Amazon expert, Brian Connolly, explains, you should think small and specific when sourcing influencers for your brand. “Don’t go for someone with just a large, general following. You have a better chance of getting engagement and sales from a more niche account.” For example, “if you sell soccer equipment, find someone in the soccer space with a following.”Ed Carlin, another of Jungle Scout’s expert ecommerce sellers and the host of our weekly Tool Tip Tuesday webinar, echoes this idea: “accounts with millions of followers may be less effective than up-and-comers.” He explains that a micro-influencer’s audience may be more receptive to sponcon, because there’s generally less of it on their feed. On top of that, “pricing is all over the place,” says Ed of the influencer industry. Smaller, niche influencer accounts may fit your budget better than more famous ones.  Getting in touch with potential influencers is as easy as sending them a direct message on Instagram. Try searching hashtags related to your product or brand to find niche influencers. You can also use tools like Buzzsumo or TrendSpottr to identify good candidates. 11. Make it easy to shop your brand on social media The underlying goal behind establishing a social media presence is to build your brand’s audience. But don’t lose sight of your other important objective: converting followers into customers.  Consumers are increasingly tech-savvy and mobile when it comes to shopping online, with 69% making purchases through their phones. You’ve got to make it as easy as possible for your social media followers to purchase your products. Here’s how:Create points-of-sale on Instagram and Facebook for in-app shoppin Link to your product listing, ecommerce storefront, or official landing page in your social media bios  Make sure your social media handles closely match your brand name or website domain for easy Googling You can use tools like Linktree or Shorby to link to multiple URLs from within your social media account bio sections. 12. Promote low-selling products Ever have a product that just won’t sell well on Amazon? For whatever reason — its few or poor reviews, price point, or lack of a certain je ne sais quoi — your product just hasn’t enticed customers, and you’re ready to give up on it. Before you do that, try rehabilitating the product on social media. You don’t have to spend any more advertising dollars on the low-seller — just post some organic content to highlight its best features or most useful functions, amplify its positive reviews, and offer coupons and discounts to followers. Don’t underestimate Instagram’s ability to flip a once-hated product into a new favorite — if people can use it to make 2000s-era clothing cool again, you can use it to save your low-performing product. 13. Run advertising campaigns to broaden your reach On social platforms, organic content goes a long way — but so does good, old-fashioned advertising. Leveraging social media’s incredible targeting capabilities is a great way to get noticed by users who might otherwise never find your account. You can run ads on pretty much any popular social media platform, but the most popular platforms for marketers include Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. On that note, let me take a moment to geek out a little about Facebook’s ad technology. You’re probably used to seeing digital advertisements all over the internet. As many people have noted, it’s hard to overlook how weirdly relevant they can be.If you’ve taken out ads for your brand on Amazon or Google, you know that they find audiences based on data they’ve collected about people’s online viewing and purchasing habits. Facebook takes the concept of audience targeting and turns it up several notches. How do they do it? With help from every Facebook user, of course. Facebook functions as a search engine, ecommerce platform, and a social media channel. Through its many user bio fields, friend and family networks, groups, and “followable” pages, it collects personal data about users’ identities and interests as well as their browsing and shopping behaviors. All of that data lends itself to “ridiculously powerful” targeting strategies that uncover every possible relevant user. Want your posts to reach Millennial moms who work from home? Spanish-speaking churchgoers in Naples, Florida? Budget-savvy West Coast retirees? With a bit of toggling in the targeting settings, you can do that.In addition, Facebook ads can be formatted to closely resemble organic posts. As Ed notes, this makes ads look “more authentic and credible” than other digital ads. Users can like, share, and comment on ads, just as they would with any other content that appears in their feed. Ed recommends setting up a Facebook business account for your brand so you can earn followers, run ads, and sell products in Facebook Marketplace as the official brand owner. He notes that you can also add multiple users to a business account, so your staff, business partner, or virtual assistant can help you manage your Facebook operations. 14. Answer questions and respond kindly to feedback Take advantage of your proximity to shoppers and use social channels as an outlet for customer support. Answer questions, thank users for positive feedback, and have a plan for handling sticky situations. The internet can be an unkind place for brands, where dunking on official accounts yields its own kind of social currency. Spend five minutes browsing recently-posted Tweets about any airline and you’ll see what I mean. As a business owner, you’re bound to run into the occasional bit of negative feedback on social media, whether it’s a mean tweet or a rude YouTube comment complaining about your products or service. This is the only rule you need to remember when dealing with internet hate: kill them with kindness. Respond to angry comments with empathy, and always lead with an apology and direct action remedy the issue. To avoid a high-visibility dispute in public comments, send the unhappy account a direct message. That way, you can soothe the angry customer, troubleshoot a problem, and prevent further issues from happening in the future. Here are some great examples of brands doing excellent customer service through social channels to give you ideas. Users won’t always tag you in their complaints on social media. To stay on top of feedback, good and bad, listen for mentions of your brand by monitoring relevant keywords and hashtags. You can also keep an eye out for mentions of your competitors — see what social media users love and hate about brands similar to yours, and use those insights to improve your products.   15. Track your success As with any marketing effort, you have to examine the data to know what works and what doesn’t. Figuring out which social media platforms generate engagement and conversions for your brand will save you time and money. Use tools like Amazon Attribution, Later, Agorapulse, Sprout Social, and Hootsuite for powerful social media analytics. Here are the questions you’ll want to ask as you go through your performance metrics: What kinds of content earn the most engagement, reach, likes, and shares?What tone resonates the most with my followers? What time of day is best for posting content? Which platform helps me accrue the most followers and engagement? Once you have the answers, make decisions to optimize your social strategy: keep the top-performing content and channels, and ditch the rest. Start earning followers today Using social media is a fun way to broaden your audience and earn loyal fans of your brand. Between tracking engagement, sourcing high-quality content, and keeping up with what followers want, there are a lot of moving parts involved in running an effective social media marketing strategy.  Remember that it all comes down to a few simple guidelines: strive for quality and authenticity, respond with kindness to any feedback, and don’t take yourself too seriously.

    headline:"10 social media best practices for 2023",
    body:"1. Check out what competitors are doing  These days, people tend to get their first impression from a brand on social media. So, how does your social media presence stack up against your competitors? If you really want an informed strategy, knowing what rival companies are doing in the space is key so you can strategize ways to set your brand apart. Plus, with social media platforms making it easy to find, track, and analyze competitors, your team can easily put together an audit in no time.  Look at the content competitors are publishing and ask:  What messaging and media are being implemented? Video? Images? User Generated Content (UGC)? What demographics do they appear to be targeting?  How much are they spending? How frequently – and when – are they posting?Are they using influencers or partnering with other businesses to boost visibility? What seems to be performing well and what doesn’t?  Answering these questions will give you insight into how to make your social media campaigns better and increase the likelihood that you can gain better traction on these channels.Make sure you audit your competitors at least once a year to see what new strategies they might be leveraging.   Also, you don’t always have to limit your search to direct competitors for inspiration. You can browse other industries to see the latest trends your team could implement or even take note of the campaigns that resonate with you in your personal use of social media. 2. Understand your audience’s social media preferenceKnowing your customers is one of the most important foundational steps for any marketing campaign. Social media gives us the power to cultivate a massive collection of customer data that we can use to guide business decisions and our marketing strategies.  Apart from general demographics information, the following are good questions to ask when compiling audience data for your campaigns:Which platform(s) does your customer base use? o all of my buyer personas gravitate toward the same platform? Or are they divided in their preferences?  What do your customers value?  What do you need to convince your customers to buy your product or service? For example, 74% of younger people (gen Z and millennials)dislike being targeted by social media brands. Building trust with these generations involves a two-way dialogue, with sources such as blogs and online communities carrying far more credibility than traditional advertising. Younger users are much more resistant to being pitched at or sold to. They want an experience that feels organic and authentic Where are you in terms of brand awareness? Does your audience already recognize your brand? What do you want to change or maintain about how consumers perceive the brand on social media? Keep in mind that the answers to these questions may change on a campaign-to-campaign basis depending on the customer persona, product type, media type, etc. You may need to set up separate strategies for each social platform, or for each persona. Social media can provide you with some of this information if you don’t already have it. Use those insights. Based on Gartner’s research, only one percent of companies who regularly tap into their stores of social media and legacy customer data use it to its full potential.When you understand the needs and expectations of customers, you can fundamentally reshape the sales funnel and shift the way customers view our brands. 3. Establish and maintain your brand’s voic Establishing your brand voice sounds like a no-brainer, but many brands don’t fully get this right on their social media channels. Maintaining a consistent voice helps your brand be recognizable among competitors and stay true to its values. For social media in particular, you’ll want to establish the following for social media processes:  Visual style and tone   A content approval process and cadence How niche words your brand commonly uses are spelled, capitalized, etc.Consistent hashtags and slogans — especially those including your brand’s name Important resources to share (and which ones to avoid sharing) Guidelines for responding to comments   If your brand hasn’t defined its voice, it’s a good idea to lay out some guidelines for your team. Consider why your brand exists, what it values, how you want to describe your brand, and how you want customers to feel when interacting with your brand.   You can even use your customer and competitor research to determine the brand voice style that most resonates with your target audience. Use any personas generated from customer research to create a voice that speaks to those customers. You can do competitor research to see how they approach brand voice and then decide if you want to improve upon that strategy or go in a different direction.  Brand voice is the vehicle for telling your brand’s story, so cultivate it carefully. No matter who you’re writing for, remember the best way to build trust is to talk with, not at, your customers. That way, you can build a network of trusted stakeholders around your brand.  4. Figure out the right time and amount to post for your brand, then create and follow a social media calenda The question of when to post seems to haunt most brands new to social media, perhaps because it’s one of the easiest things to control. While there are some theories as to when (most sources claim 10am Tuesday-Thursday is the best time), the honest answer to that question is quite a bit more complicated. Different customers can live in vastly different time zones, and not everyone has a standard 9-5 job. So the real best practice for social media marketing in terms of timing and frequency is — yet again — dependent upon your customer. Leverage social marketing analytics to better understand the performance of your content based on time of day, frequency, geography, and more. Then you can use the insights to adapt your social publishing strategy for optimal performance. The same goes for post frequency.  This is another excellent opportunity to use your competitor and customer research to inform your marketing strategy. Ask some basic questions:  When and how often are my competitors posting content ?   How well does it seem to be working for them?How would a different cadence perform? Similarly, by tracking how your audience reacts to the timing of your posts, you can refine your cadence to take advantage of the most opportune posting times. Once you have this information established, set up a calendar that everyone involved can reference. It’s easy to think you’ll remember to pop in a new post here and there, but then all of a sudden, three months will have gone by, and the last thing your brand published is a (now entirely irrelevant) meme. Khoros Marketing  5. Use tools to plan and automate task  Tools and automation keep you organized and let you focus on the most important tasks instead of getting bogged down with repetitive, menial jobs. Enlist the help of tools to make your day-to-day job easier and more efficient, and eliminate or automate inefficient tasks where possible. The suite of tools used to improve social media management has become increasingly robust. Here are a few examples: Social Media Integrations unify and integrate your customer engagement operations. This goes beyond just social media platforms (of which there are many) and includes SMS and chat applications, YouTube, Google My Business, email, review platforms, chatbots, and so on. Social Media Listening, which is different than social media monitoring, involves seeking out and analyzing involves seeking out and analyzing the sentiment of your brand, competitors, and industry. Tools for social media listening gather this information together, so you don’t have to spend your time seeking it out. They are invaluable for planning and creating content your audience is interested in.  Social Media Calendars or schedulers can be especially helpful when posting content when a brand wants to and on the appropriate channels. Scheduling posts in advance frees you up so that you’re not constantly at your computer, waiting to press publish on your next post.Social media management is no longer something brands can responsibly assign to an intern and forget about. It requires commitment and can be very time-consuming if you’re not using tools like these to increase your efficiency and knowledge.6. Respond to customers promptly One of the biggest draws of social media is that it allows for interaction. Still, many brands are initially surprised by the number of questions and requests they receive through their social media channels.  Speed is crucial to maintaining a happy customer base. Customers have high expectations for a quick response: half of social media users expect a brand to respond to their tweet and demand a response within three hours. Brands that fail to meet this expectation risk losing customers. About 30% of customers said they would stop giving a brand their business and express their dissatisfaction on social media and with friends and family.Not surprisingly, over 40% of customers who reach out to brands on social media are more likely to buy and encourage their friends and families to buy from companies that provide them with a timely response.Learn more about the consumer expectations for social media customer service in our new report or how chatbots can seamlessly automate aspects of your social media customer service.7. Tap into subject matter experts at your organization  There is no better way to get the correct answer to a complicated question or create in-depth, nuanced, and exciting content than to appeal to the experts within your organization. Don’t be afraid to tap into subject matter experts across all departments to assist with customer issues or generate new ideas. While your subject experts might not know how to market what’s unique to their brand, they are the key to what makes your brand different, and appealing to their knowledge will ultimately drive higher customer satisfaction ratings.8. Share customer feedback — especially when it’s positiv There is a misconception that social media marketing is all about interacting with the people who are external to your company. But who is most likely to have their work shared on your social media platforms? When your customers experience satisfactory resolutions to specific issues, particularly those using social channels, ask that customer if you can share those conversations or if they would like to leave a review. Not just on your social media but internally as well.  Building internal excitement and encouraging a collaborative approach to social participation can boost morale and transform your employees into brand advocates. If you have an online brand community, use Community Syndication to place positive customer reviews anywhere they need to go. (And if you don’t have an online brand community, consider how adding one might improve your bottom line.)9. Set goals and pursue them Have you ever started creating a fun social media campaign and realized that you didn’t know exactly what you wanted your brand to get out of it? And by exactly, do we mean a hard number to work toward within a reasonable amount of time?For many brands, the current impetus for upping their social media is to “increase brand awareness,” “boost brand engagement,” or “build a community.” These goals aren’t as measurable as “increase revenue,” but there are metrics associated with these ideas. In particular, look at how your social media is impacting these numbers to gain insights into the reach and influence of your campaigns  Post views  Followers (real, not paid)  Email sign-ups generated by social media campaigns Visits to your website from your social platforms Numbers of likes, comments, hashtags, shares, saves, subscriptions, etc.  Social-generated sales and conversions  Response time Reviews Challenge yourself to measure the social media impact on your business. This will give you executive-level support to secure a budget for resources like technology tools and team personnel and ultimately prove that you’re adding value. Khoros Communities 10. Measure results with social media analytics to better optimize campaign Social media managers can neither prove their value nor optimize their efforts without hard data. Use a social marketing analytics tool that helps you both measure and optimize your social programs. This works in the same way companies have long measured and optimized search, email, and other proven digital channels. Having social media analytics can tell you when your social media strategy is working, and when you need to pivot. After all, a well-thought-out strategy is great, but  sometimes things happen during the implementation of those strategies that we don’t expect. In these times, it’s important to be adaptable so that you may alter your strategy and respond to the situation at hand. This can help humanize your brand in the eyes of consumers and show that you are not out of touch.Khoros makes it easy to follow social media best practices If you’re ready to use social media to impact your brand in 2023 positively, you’re in the right place.

    headline:"Social Media Ad Best Practices: How to Create Killer Social Media Ads That Drive Better Leads",
    body:"1. Determine your target audience    One of the most helpful social media advertising tips is to determine your target audience. Your target audience plays a pivotal role in determining whether your ad succeeds or flops. If you aren’t targeting the right people, they won’t take an interest in your ad, and you won’t earn new leads or sales for your business.So, how do you determine your target audience? Look at your typical customer that comes into your store or visits your website. What attributes define your customer base?You can focus on commonalities like: Age range Gender Marital/family status Occupation Hobbies /interestsIncome  And more You can use all this information to build a mockup of your typical customer. When you understand who you’re targeting, you can set your ads to target those people and deliver a message that resonates with them and their needs. 2. Choose the right platforms If you want to follow social media best practices for advertising, start by choosing your platform.  You may feel as though you must have a social presence on every social network, but that’s not the case. It’s more important that you pick the right platforms, so you put your time and resources into the right place.Knowing your target audience is one of the most crucial social media marketing best practices for two reasons:It helps you target the right people  It enables you to choose the right platforms    You want to use social media networks where your audience hangs out online and is likely to engage with businesses. It’s essential that you know who you’re targeting so you can figure out which platforms they use the most. Look at the demographics for each social media platform to see where your audience spends their time. If you find your audience spends time on more than one network, you can invest in a social media advertising strategy that focuses on multiple platforms. You aren’t limited to just one platform, and you certainly don’t need to invest in every platform if your audience isn’t active on them. Finding the right social networks is an essential best practice for social media.3. Set goals for your social media ads    If you run a social media advertising campaign, set goals. You can’t run a successful campaign without knowing what you want to achieve! Follow best practices for social media ads and set a goal for each campaign.  Generally, your social media advertising goals will align with your company’s overall goals. Whether you want to increase revenue or earn new clients, you need to know what your business wants to accomplish.Your company’s larger goals influence your marketing strategy, which affects your social media advertising campaign goals  So, for example, if your company wants to increase revenue, you may develop a marketing plan that aims to boost sales. As a result, you decide to set your social media ad objective to focus on earning conversions. When you create ad copy for your campaign, you focus on ad copy that persuades people to purchase your products or use your services. Setting goals allows you to track your campaign progress, too. When you know what you’re aiming to achieve, you can deliver an ad experience that accomplishes your goals.4. Set your brand tone and voice  One of the most fundamental social media ad best practices is establishing your brand tone and voice. Whether you share organic content or run an advertising campaign, your tone and voice should be the same. You want to create a consistent brand style, so users build brand recognition with your company. When creating your brand tone and voice, think about how you currently portray your brand. Do you take a lighthearted and casual approach to your marketing? Or, are you more formal with your branding For example, if you own a casual clothing boutique, you want to convey that message to your audience. You want to use photos and text to communicate the casual tone of your business. When you emphasize your brand tone in your ads, you represent your brand better. 5. Use high-quality visuals When you advertise on social media, use high-quality visuals. This social media advertising best practice is critical because visuals can make or break your ad. If you’re using low-quality photos or videos, your audience is less likely to trust your adt They will think your company is untrustworthy and won’t interact with your ad. Not to mention, high-quality visuals are more appealing to your audience and are more likely to catch their attention. When using photos in your ads, ensure you’re using images relevant to your campaign.For example, if you run a Facebook ad for your clothing boutique’s coats, the image featured in the ad should be the coats. It wouldn’t make sense to have an ad that promotes your blouses or shoes. As for videos, use engaging and exciting videos.You may need to do some testing to see how long you can make your videos, but the content should catch someone’s attention immediately. If you have relevant ad content, you’ll get users to watch your ad. By focusing on high-quality and relevant visuals, you’ll garner more ad engagement and build trust with your audience. 6. Create a relevant landing page  Another essential social media advertising tip involves your landing page. Having a visually appealing and exciting ad is only half of the puzzle. The other half requires creating a landing page that provides all the information a visitor needs about your product or service    Your landing page is where leads go after clicking on your ad. To have a successful ad campaign, you must create a landing page (which you can do with a landing page creation tool) that fits with your ad. If you’re running an ad about your clothing boutique’s coats, for example, the landing page should have relevant information about the coats you’re selling.For instance, users should learn what your coats costs, whether you have a return policy, and more. When you create your landing page, focus solely on the content of your ad. If you’re creating an advertisement for your coats, the landing page should focus strictly on the coats and no other products.  Your landing page should provide your audience with relevant information that helps them learn more about your product or service. It’s an excellent opportunity for you to show how your product or service will help improve a shopper’s life.  7. Use the right call to action (CTA) When you run an advertising campaign, you must guide people to the next step. If you want to get people to visit your landing page, you need the right call to action (CTA) to get them to click and visit your page. The best social media ads have relevant CTAs that guide users to the next step and tell them how to proceed. With most social media ads, you will choose a pre-defined CTA for your ad. Even with these predefined CTAs, you must select the right one for your campaign. If you’re trying to get someone to buy your product, having “Sign Up” as your CTA may not be the best option for your advertising campaign.Instead, a CTA like “Book Now” or “Get Offer” would fit your ad better. Choosing an appropriate CTA puts your audience on the right track and guides them to the next step. 8. Test your ads  One of the most critical social media ad best practices is testing your ads. When you create an ad for social media, you must test your ad content. The first version may not garner the most engagement, so experiment with different ad copy to see which version drives the best results.When testing your ad copy, test each element separately. If you try changing and testing too many features, you won’t get precise results and know which parts positively impact your ad’s performance. You can test multiple elements on your page, including your:Ad copy  Visual element  CTA  And more You must check different aspects of your ad to drive the best results. 9. Monitor your ad’s performance One of the most fundamental social media ad best practices is to monitor your ad’s performance. You don’t want to launch an advertising campaign and abandon it. If you don’t check your ad’s performance, you won’t get the best return on investment (ROI) for your business.  No matter which platform you choose, you’ll have access to metrics on your ad’s performance. You can monitor behaviors such as: Views   Clicks Conversions  And more You want to watch your ad to see if you’re effectively driving the results you desire. It’s critical that when monitoring your ad, you don’t just focus on one metric. For example, let’s say you’re running an ad where the focus is on people buying your product. Based on the available metrics, you may think you only need to monitor your conversions. So, you decide to track your conversions and see that they’re not as high as you want.You conclude that the ad isn’t working and that you should start over. If you monitored multiple metrics, however, you’d have a different perspective. You could look at your clicks, for example, and see that your ad generated a lot of clicks, but not a lot of conversions, which could mean an issue with your landing page.  So, as a result, you rework that landing page to drive better results. When you monitor multiple metrics, you spot problems easier. Plus, you get a complete perspective when it comes to your social media ad campaign.   You see where engagement drops off, which allows you to analyze your ad and make appropriate changes to drive better results. 10. Be mindful of ad fatigure This next social media advertising tip goes with the previous tip. When monitoring your ads, look for signs of ad fatigue. Ad fatigue is when your audience becomes less responsive to your ads because they keep seeing the same ad from your business repeatedly.    You may have an ad that has high engagement and interest when you initially launch it, but then you start to see a decline in all your metrics as you continue to run the ad. Ad fatigue is common, so it’s nothing to freak out over, though you do want to resolve it. If an ad isn’t working for your audience anymore, it’s time to cycle out that ad and try a new one to get more engagement. When you create your ads, it’s good to build multiple versions of the same advertisement. If you create multiple versions, you have new ads to use when your audience gets tired of the old ones. You don’t need to change the focus of your ad necessarily, but rather, present the information in a new and engaging way.11. Utilize retargeted ads One of the best social media ad best practices for your business is to use retargeted ads. Whether you want to earn email sign-ups, form submissions, or purchases, retargeted ads work for every conversion goal. These ads appear before people who checked out your business previously but didn’t convert. These people may have put an item in their cart, for example, or spent a long time on a crucial services page. Retargeted ads serve as a reminder to your audience that they were interested in your brand. Social media creates an excellent opportunity for you to retarget customers you know have an interest in your business. You can put your brand in front of them and get them thinking about your company, products, and services again."

    headline:"Become a Successful SMM in 10 Steps",
    body:"What is social media marketing (SMM)? Social media marketing (SMM) typically refers to the use of online communities, social networks, and Internet media collaboration platforms to achieve marketing conversion through various methods, such as media promotion, attracting new users, and maintaining customer relationships.Social media marketing, a key battleground for new media marketing, has also provided new impetus to companies involved in traditional marketing and a boost in marketing behavior. So, how does a successful social media marketing campaign get planned and executed? Take a look at the ten ideas below.  1. Design Your Strategies You need to follow several steps to become a successful SMM. First, define your goals and objectives. Doing this will determine what kind of content you need and if it is likely to help you reach your goals. After defining your goals and objectives, brainstorm some ideas for content that aligns with these objectives. Then set a schedule for creating this content so it can be published on time—and ensure it's consistent! Next up: define your target audience so that every piece of content resonates with this audience—it should also be aligned with their values/beliefs/needs/desires (whatever they may be). Once these things are decided, develop strategies for each social media platform based on the type of information shared (i.e., text vs. photo vs. gif vs. video).  2. Starting Live Broadcast    Because it allows you to connect with your audience in real time, live streaming is one of the most popular social media marketing tools. It will allow them to interact with you and become involved in your business. If done, live streaming can be a good way to increase brand awareness, build trust and improve customer service for your target audience.  What You'll Need: A camera or phone that supports live streaming (or a laptop) - You can use any device with a camera built-in or connected via a USB cable (webcam). A phone will work, too, if it supports live streaming through its camera app.When using a laptop, ensure there's no glare from windows or lights behind you; otherwise, this could mess up how well people can see what's happening on screen when watching via computer/laptop screen-sharing software such as Skype or Beamr (see below). 3. Social Media Influencer  Social media influencer is a term used to describe a person who significantly impacts consumers' purchasing decisions.  Influencers can be celebrities and well-known public figures, but they can also be regular people with large followers and engagement on social media. Influencers can be paid or unpaid, but most receive compensation for their posts/content.social media influencer 4. Create Subscription Options Subscription options are one of the best features of social media marketing. People who subscribe to your channel will be notified via email about all new posts you make on that channel. The subscriber can then choose to accept or decline the notification.To create a subscription option: Navigate to  on the top right corner of your page and select Subscription Options from the dropdown menu.Enter your desired name and description, then click Save Changes at the bottom of this section To set up a subscription:5. Engage with your Audience  Engaging with your audience is a great way to keep them coming back and to ensure that your content is relevant. Here are some ways you can engage with your audience:Respond to comments in real-time. Responding to comments on social media is a great way to get immediate feedback from your community, show them that they're being heard, and start discussions around topics they care about.  Answer questions in the comments section of your posts or videos. Ask for feedback on new products or services you are launching. This can be as simple as asking what customers want you to create next! 6. Create User Generated Content  It's important to remember that social media is about the community, so it's important to encourage your audience members to create content. If you're not getting user-generated content (UGC) on your website or blog, you're losing out on a lot of potential traffic and engagement. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can make sure that UGC happens:Encourage your followers to share images that relate to your brand or products using hashtags such as #yourbrandname and #yourproductsname. This will help people find those posts later when searching for related content. If someone posts something valuable on your platforms (Twitter, Instagram), comment and thank them for their contribution! It shows appreciation for their time and effort in creating something useful for others.  7. Create a Positive Brand Image .Create a positive brand image. The first thing you want to do is create a positive brand image for yourself and your company. This will help you stand out from the competition and set yourself up for success in all areas of social marketing, especially on social media, where people constantly look for new products or services to try out.Use the right words and images. The best way to convey this is through your website's design, which should be clean, easy to navigate (especially on mobile), simple in style, but modern enough that it looks good with everything else being made today. create a positive brand image  It's a good idea to choose a domain name that matches your business name precisely, so there's no confusion when people visit it online. Or you could go for something generic but memorable like.8. Create a Content Plan for your Brand The first step in creating a successful SMM strategy is to create a content plan. You can create a content calendar to help you stay on track and be more efficient in your efforts. Content planning is important for SMM because it will help you stay focused on what needs to be done, how much time each task takes, and who should do it. The result of having a sound content plan will be an increase in productivity and efficiency while also allowing you to stay on track with your goals.9. Keep an Eye on Competition and Trends  Monitor your competitors and be aware of what is happening in the industry. Take advantage of social media to keep up with industry trends and find out what your audience is interested in. Social media can also help you determine what your competition is doing.10. Participate in Social Media Events Social media events can be a great way to get your name out there and promote your brand.They are a good way to get new leads. You can also use social media events to build your brand's reputation. BONUS: Just keep sending out a message One of the most important things to remember is that consistency is the key. You need to be constantly promoting yourself, not just every so often. Don't just post a message once and assume that people will see it and buy from you because they won't! bonus just keep sending out message It should be easy for people to find you on social media if they want to buy your products or services. You have to keep sending out messages and posting updates until they do! Social media can be hard work sometimes but don't give up hope; if you keep trying, it will eventually pay off!
